# Opinion Share: A Full-Stack Web Development Learning Project

This project is designed as a practical, hands-on learning experience to build a full-stack web application. The goal is to solidify understanding and develop proficiency in modern web development technologies. We will create a platform where users can share and discuss opinions, focusing on core web development principles and best practices.

## Learning Objectives

* **Frontend Development:**
    * Mastering HTML5 for semantic structure.
    * Developing responsive and visually appealing designs using CSS3 and Bootstrap.
    * Implementing interactive features with JavaScript.
    * Using Font Awesome for icon integration.
* **Backend Development:**
    * Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js.
    * Implementing server-side rendering with EJS.
    * Managing data with MongoDB and Mongoose.
* **Full-Stack Integration:**
    * Connecting the frontend and backend using API calls.
    * Implementing basic user authentication and authorization.
    * Handling user uploaded images.
* **Database Management:**
    * Designing and implementing a MongoDB database schema.
    * Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
* **Version Control:**
    * Using Git for version control and collaboration.

## Technology Stack

* **Database:**
    * MongoDB
    * Mongoose

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to clone the project and run it on your local machine:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    * **Git:** [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * **Node.js and npm:** [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm comes with Node.js)
    * **MongoDB:** [Install MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

    Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual URL of your Git repository and `[repository directory]` with the directory name.

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend # Navigate to the backend directory
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Navigate to the frontend directory
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Set up MongoDB:**

    * Ensure MongoDB is running. Start the MongoDB server if it's not already running.
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your MongoDB connection string:

        ```dotenv
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/opinion-share
        ```

        Replace `opinion-share` with your desired database name.

6.  **Run the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../backend # Navigate to the backend directory
    npm start
    ```

    The server should start running on `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

7.  **Open the Frontend:**

    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. The backend will render the EJS templates, which will serve your frontend.

## Important Notes

* Ensure that MongoDB is running before starting the backend server.
* If you encounter any dependency issues, try deleting the `node_modules` folders in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories and running `npm install` again.
* The `.env` file should not be committed to your Git repository. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.
* This is a learning project, so the authentication and authorization are basic. In a production environment, you would implement more robust security measures.
* Image handling is also basic, be sure to add more server side image validation, and processing for production use.
